node-level-logserver
====================

A log server for asynchronous logging. Persisted by leveldb.

This may be one part in a larger eco-system of tools, such as an emailer, web interface, log parser. etcetera

I plan to start by supporting a REST API and a TCP Socket Layer, then maybe move on to supporting UDP.
